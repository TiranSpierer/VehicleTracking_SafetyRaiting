### **Idea 6**
  'Idea 6' is an automated program that gives drivers' a ‘safety rating’ based on their driving behaviors. 
  It tracks their vehicle through a stationary camera placed on any open road or highway.

### **Overview**
  *	The Program will ask the user to upload a short video of an open road with general traffic or a specific vehicle to track 
  *	The video will then be processed and the program will detect:
    *	Lanes
    
    *	Vehicles
    *	Road Shoulders
    *	Road Boundaries
    *	Salt-and-Pepper Noise
		
  *	Each object (vehicle) will be tracked, numbered (ID) and receive a score based on their driving behaviors.
  *	Score is based on:
    *	Speed
    *	Lane splitting
    *	Passing on the right
    *	Drifting into the shoulders
  *	Output: Vehicle ID’s and their scores
